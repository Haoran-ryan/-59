# Leetcoe 110 Balanced Binary Tree

## Takeaways

1. The key is move from 'bottom-up' - Calculate results for leaf nodes first
2. Recursive function - not modify existing variables but creating new values which get passed up the call stack
3. Break into small bits - is a node balanced? If yes, height
4. Base case - difficult to define
5. Recursive call - FUNNY THOUGHT 'Trust The Recursion'

   ```python
    left_balanced, left_height = check_balance(node.left)
    # "This will give me accurate information about the balance and height of the left subtree." Don't worry about how it does thisâ€”just trust that it will, because you're defining the function to do exactly that.
   ```

```python
def isBalanced(self, root):
    balanced, _ = self.check_balance(root)
    return balanced

def check_balance(self, node):
    if not node:
        return True, -1 # TODO: key - if the prev node is a leaf node

    left_balanced, left_height = self.check_balance(node.left)

    # Early return optimization: if left subtree is unbalanced,
    # the whole tree is unbalanced
    if not left_balanced:
        return False, 0  # Height doesn't matter anymore

    right_balanced, right_height = self.check_balance(node.right)

    # Early return optimization: if right subtree is unbalanced,
    # the whole tree is unbalanced
    if not right_balanced:
        return False, 0  # Height doesn't matter anymore

    # Check if current node maintains the balance condition
    is_balanced = abs(left_height - right_height) <= 1

    # Calculate the height of current subtree
    height = max(left_height, right_height) + 1

    return is_balanced, height  # two values: bool, int
```

# Leetcode 257 Binary Tree Paths

## Takeaways

1. Base case definition
   1. This base case in `check_path` does not work
   2. should check if a recursive call has reached a leaf node (instead of stepping outside from a leaf)

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def binaryTreePaths(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[str]:
        if root is None:
            return root

        cur_path = ''
        def check_path(node, cur_path):
            if node is None:
                return cur_path

            left = check_path(node.left, cur_path)
            right = check_path(node.right, cur_path)



```

2. When to add a node to a sub path?
3. How to manage subpath, clean it for a new around of path searching ?

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def binaryTreePaths(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[str]:
        if root is None:
            return root  # ISSUE: Should return empty list [] instead of root

        cur_path = []  # This is a good start - creating a path list
        def check_path(node, cur_path):

            if node.left is None and node.right is None:
                cur_path.append(node.val)  # ISSUE: This only adds the leaf node value
                                           # ISSUE: Not converting to string for joining later
                                           # ISSUE: Not adding this complete path to any result collection
                return cur_path  # ISSUE: Returning the path doesn't collect it anywhere

            # ISSUE: You're not adding the current node's value to the path before recursing
            # ISSUE: Missing the case where a node has BOTH left and right children

            if node.left is None:  # This handles only right child
                return check_path(node.right, cur_path)  # ISSUE: Using same cur_path object for all paths

            if node.right is None:  # This handles only left child
                return check_path(node.left, cur_path)  # ISSUE: Using same cur_path object for all paths

            # ISSUE: No handling for the case when node has both children

        check_path(root,cur_path)  # ISSUE: Not collecting the result of this call
                                   # ISSUE: Not creating a master list to collect all paths

        return cur_path  # ISSUE: This returns only the last path found, not all paths
                         # ISSUE: Not formatting paths as strings with "->" separator

```

4. When to use `.copy()` in recursion?
   You should use `.copy()` (or similar methods for creating copies) in recursive functions when you need to maintain separate, independent versions of a mutable data structure across different recursive branches. Here are the key scenarios where copying is important:

1. **When tracking paths in tree traversals**: Like in the binary tree paths problem we discussed, you need separate copies of the path for each branch of the tree.

1. **When maintaining state that shouldn't be shared** between different recursive calls, especially in depth-first searches or backtracking algorithms.

1. **When a recursive function modifies a data structure** and you don't want those modifications to affect other recursive calls.

The general rule is: use `.copy()` when multiple recursive calls need to work with their own versions of the same data structure, particularly when:

- The data structure is mutable (like lists, dictionaries, sets)
- Changes to the data structure in one branch shouldn't affect other branches
- You're building up solutions incrementally (like paths, combinations, permutations)

Common examples in algorithms:

- Path finding in graphs or trees
- Generating all possible combinations or permutations
- Backtracking problems (N-Queens, Sudoku solver, etc.)
- Building trees or trying different decision paths

You typically don't need `.copy()` when:

- Working with immutable data (integers, strings, tuples)
- Only one recursive branch is explored at a time
- The recursive function doesn't modify the shared data structure
- You're accumulating results in a global collection that all recursive calls can safely modify

#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left

        if root is None:
            return []  # Return empty list instead of root

        result = []  # Create a master list to store all complete paths

        def check_path(node, cur_path):
            # Add current node's value to the path
            cur_path.append(str(node.val))  # Convert to string for later joining

            # Check if current node is a leaf node
            if node.left is None and node.right is None:
                # We found a complete path - add it to our result list
                result.append("->".join(cur_path))  # Join with -> delimiter
                return  # No need to return anything - we've added path to result

            # If node has left child, explore that path
            if node.left:
                check_path(node.left, cur_path.copy())  # Use copy to avoid modifying the same list

            # If node has right child, explore that path
            if node.right:
                check_path(node.right, cur_path.copy())  # Use copy to avoid modifying the same list

            # No need to return anything from this function

        # Start recursion with empty path
        check_path(root, [])

        return result  # Return the master list of all paths
```
