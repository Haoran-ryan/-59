# LeetCode 202 - Happy Number (Q&A)

## Take-ways

1. What is a Happy Number?
A Happy Number is defined as a number which eventually reaches 1 when replaced by the sum of the square of each digit.

2. What are the ways to extract digits from an integer?
   1. Using modulo (%) and division operations - efficient approach
   2. Converting to string and iterating through characters
   3. Bitwise operations - not typically used for this problem

3. What are the possible ending conditions for this problem?
   1. The number becomes 1 (happy number)
   2. We detect a cycle (unhappy number)

4. How do we determine if there's a cycle?
If we encounter the same sum more than once, we've detected a cycle. This can be tracked using a hash set or similar data structure to store previously seen sums.

5. What's the time and space complexity?

   - Time Complexity: O(log n) for the digit extraction process, with a bounded number of iterations before finding a cycle
   - Space Complexity: O(log n) to store the seen numbers in the hash set

6. This problem demonstrates cycle detection, similar to the "Linked List Cycle" problem, but in a different context.

7. What were the common mistakes in my implementation?
Incomplete Digit Processing: Not properly extracting and processing all digits before checking conditions. The sum of squares calculation needs to be completed for the entire number first.
Loop Structure Issues: Using incorrect loop conditions that could cause infinite loops or premature exits.
Missing Reset Logic: Not resetting the running total before processing a new iteration of the number.
Condition Placement: Checking for end conditions (1 or cycle detection) in the middle of digit extraction rather than after completing the sum.
Case Sensitivity: Python is case-sensitive, so false needs to be False.

8. What's the correct algorithm flow?
Create a set to track seen numbers
Loop until we find 1 or detect a cycle:

Calculate sum of squares of all digits (complete this calculation)
Check if sum equals 1 (return True)
Check if sum has been seen before (return False)
Add sum to seen set
Update n with the new sum for next iteration

9. Why does cycle detection matter in this problem?
For unhappy numbers, the process will eventually enter a cycle (repeat the same sequence of numbers). Detecting this cycle is crucial to avoid an infinite loop.
