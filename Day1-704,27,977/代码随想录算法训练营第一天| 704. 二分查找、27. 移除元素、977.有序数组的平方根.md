# Binary Search

1. Mid value declaration 
   1. in the while loop
2. 2 options - [left, right] or [left, right)
```python
left = 0 
right = len(arr)  # Using [left, right) approach where right is exclusive

while left < right:  # Condition reflects exclusive right bound
    mid = left + (right-left)//2  # Avoids integer overflow

    if arr[mid] == target:
        return mid
    elif arr[mid] > target:
        right = mid  # mid here now serves as the right boundary which is exclusive
    elif arr[mid] < target:
        left = mid + 1 
return -1  # Standard LeetCode convention for "not found"
```


# Two Pointers

## My questions:
1. do both pointers start from the same index (0 e.g.)? Or can it be `slow = 0` & `fast = 1`?
   - Can start at same index (0, 0) or different indices (0, 1)
   - Depends on problem requirements

2. Is the `fast` pointer always used to determine if a particular condition (of moving `slow`) is met?
   - Typically yes - fast explores ahead while slow only moves when conditions are met
   - Fast pointer often determines these conditions

```python
#27. Remove element
class Solution:
    def removeElement(self, nums: List[int], val: int) -> int:
        slow = 0
        fast = 0
        while fast < len(nums):  # Fixed: should check against array length, not slow
            if nums[fast] != val:  # Fixed: nums not num
                nums[slow] = nums[fast]  # Fixed: nums not num
                slow += 1  # The element on the original slow pos is updated and we move to the next
            fast += 1
        return slow  # Return count of remaining elements
```

## Left-Right Pointers 
- For 977 Squares of a Sorted Array
- Instead of having the same starting pos (e.g. index 0), we use pointers moving from both ends of an array and meeting in the middle. 
- What i missed: have a 3rd 'pointer' starting from the end of the result array, pointing to the position-for-value-population

```python
# 977. Squares of a Sorted Array
def sortedSquares(nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    n = len(nums)
    result = [0] * n  # Create result array same size as input
    left = 0
    right = n - 1
    
    # Fill result array from back to front (largest to smallest)
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if abs(nums[left]) > abs(nums[right]):
            result[i] = nums[left] * nums[left]
            left += 1
        else:
            result[i] = nums[right] * nums[right]
            right -= 1
    return result
```

Key insights:
- For sorted arrays with negative numbers, largest square could be at either end
- Compare absolute values to determine which end has larger square
- Fill result array from right to left (largest to smallest)
